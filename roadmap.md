## Case Study Roadmap

### Ask

**What topic are you exploring?**
I intend to explore the liquidity Netflix as they relate to added movies and tv shows.

**What is the problem you are trying to solve?**
I intend to provide recommendations on what factors of an added movie or tv show may lead to increased liquidity for Netflix stock.

### Prepare

**Where is your data located?**
The datasets I am using are located on Kaggle.
- [Netflix Stock Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mayankanand2701/netflix-stock-price-dataset)
- [Netflix TV Shows and Movies (w/ rating and genre)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/victorsoeiro/netflix-tv-shows-and-movies?select=titles.csv)
- [Netflix TV Shows and Movies (w/ date added to Netflix)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows)

**How is the data organized?**
The data is organized in CSV files.

**Are there any problems with the data?**
The relevant information is segmented into these three data files. So, I must find a way to consolidate information for easy analysis.

### Process

**What tools are you choosing and why?**
I intend to use Python, Pandas, and Seaborn to process, clean, analyze, and visualize the data.

### Analyze and Share

This will be completed once the previous steps have been finished.
